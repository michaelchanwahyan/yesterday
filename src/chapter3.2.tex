\section{``YESTERDAY"}
Perhaps no word expresses the thought framework of Hebrews so well as does
``yesterday" (ἐχθές); no word serves better to prevent a false understanding of
the author's viewpoint.
This word occurs in 13.8, and in the RSV this verse is translated: ``Jesus
Christ is the same yesterday and today and for ever."
More Literally the Greek may be translated: ``Jesus Christ yesterday and today
the same and into the ages."
At first sight this verse seems to stand alone, lacking any thought connection
with either v.7 or v.9.
But this impression is misleading.
